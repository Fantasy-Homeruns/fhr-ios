# Fantasy Homeruns iOS App
Fantasy Homeruns is a not-for-profit baseball game that tracks one statistic, homeruns.  FHR is a season long game.   This repos is the new open source version for an Android App.  Recently in 2020, FHR decided to open source and collaborate with the community to build the next generation of FHR using serverless for API and latest React for the web application.  A native app for iOS does not currently exist, we're opening it up to our community to build one!
